# Experimentation with Machine Learning Algorithms

Here I have been learning myself with experimenting multiple machine learning algorithms on the same datasets for a classification problem and then trying to understand how each alogrithms behave and then deriving important insights.

# Datasets
1) Online News Popularity Dataset
2) Organic Products store data

# Algorithms implemented for Classification
1) Support Vector Machines
2) Decision Trees
3) Boosting
4) Artifical Neural Networks
5) KNN

# Algorithms implemented for Clustering and Dimensionality reduction
1) K-means
2) Expectation maximization
3) PCA
4) ICA
5) Randomized Projections


So when I say the word "EXPERIMENTATION", What did I really try and played around with? Below are few questions which I tried analysing and answering it myself and then conclude the results:
--> SVM, Decision Trees and Boosting
Which Kernel can be the best for SVM? Performance comparisons (learning curves, confusion matrices, etc.) of various functions/parameters for the algorithms (e.g. kernels in SVM, pruning in decision trees). When did I stop pruning ? How did cross validation helped me ? Which algorithm performed the best and why? How did I define the best? 

--> Artificical Neural Networks and KNN
Experiment with number of layers and number of nodes, activation functions (sigmoid, tanh,etc.) What are different optimization parameters did I played around with ?  Experimenting with number of neighbors.

--> Clustering and Dimensionality reduction
What type of clusters did I get? Did they line up with the class labels? If not, did they line up
naturally? Were they compact or not? what could the reason be for these types of clusters? Running the clustering algorithms again, but this time after applying dimensionality reduction. When I ran the clustering experiments again on the datasets projected onto the new
spaces created by ICA, PCA and RP, did I get the same clusters as before? Different clusters? Why? Why not? Comparing and contrasting the different algorithms

All the answers for those above questions has been analysed and couple of details reports has been written by me (Its just that I couldn't share it here). But I always loved and would cherish it my entire my life for this methodology of learning and experimenting with different machine learning algorithms on the same datasets.
