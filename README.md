# Experimentation with Machine Learning Algorithms

Here I have been learning myself with experimenting multiple machine learning algorithms on the same datasets for a classification problem and then trying to understand how each alogrithms behave and then deriving important insights.

# Datasets
1) Online News Popularity Dataset
2) Organic Products store data

# Algorithms implemented for Classification
1) Support Vector Machines
2) Decision Trees
3) Boosting
4) Artifical Neural Networks
5) KNN

# Algorithms implemented for Clustering and Dimensionality reduction
1) K-means
2) Expectation maximization
3) PCA
4) ICA
5) Randomized Projections
